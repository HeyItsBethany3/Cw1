For Q3 part 1b, open the folder 'Q3b-individual'. Run the files individually.
The scripts contain option I ('euler.cpp') and option II ('BrittaNewton.cpp' and
'IoannaNewton.cpp') in the form of functions, and they are tested.

For the rest of Q3, there are two files:

The first one implements 'BrittaNewton.cpp' and is called 'Q3_group_questions.cpp'. 
This outputs three .csv files for Q3d showing the left hand side of eqn (8) for each iteration 
of Newton's method at the requested time steps. The csv files are called: 'Q3d_Britta_Newton_n=1.csv', 'Q3d_Britta_Newton_n=8.csv' and 'Q3d_Britta_Newton_n=16.csv'.

The second one implements 'IoannaNewton.cpp' and is called 'Q3_group_questions(2).cpp'.
